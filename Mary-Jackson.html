       <p class="text-md-center text-light fs-6">Mary Winston Jackson was born April 9th, 1921 and she died February 11th, 2005. Her spouse was Levi Jackson, Sr. Her children were Levi Jackson, Jr, Caroline Marie Lewis. Her parents were Ella Winston, and Frank winston.
</p> 
 <p class="text-md-center text-light fs-6">Mary Jackson was the first black female engineer at Nasa. When she was at Nasa her and some other African-American women were aeronautical engineers, they did research on humans, it was called human computers. Mary was considered a "human computer" because of her math and science skills.
</p>
<p class="text-md-center text-light fs-6">She went to Hampton's all black school and she went to George P. Phoenix training school and graduated from there with honors. 5 years later she received bachelor's degrees in math and physical science and Hampton Institute. After college, before she worked with NASA she had different jobs such as teacher, bookkeeper, and receptionist. Then eventually she worked as a human computer at NACA.
</p>
<p class="text-md-center text-light fs-6">Jackson had to work hard for what she got because at the time segregation was still happening so for a while she was segregated at NACA. After a while she considered leaving her job because she was fed up. But a supervisor at NASA offered her a job at NASA with no segregation. So she took it and became the first black female engineer at NASA. 
</p> 
<p class="text-md-center text-light fs-6">By 1978 she became a human resources administrator. She was the Federal Women's Program Manager in the office and also the Affirmative Action Program Manager. Between then and 1985. Other women and minorities bettered their careers with her help, suggesting that they study and take more courses to expand their chances for promotion.

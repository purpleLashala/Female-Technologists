 <p class="text-md-center text-primary fs-5">Elizabeth Jocelyn Feinler or aka “Jake” was born March 2, 1931. She is an American Information Scientist. At the Stanford Research Institute (SRI International). She was director of the Network Research Institute from 1972 until 1989. As the ARPANET evolved into the Defense Data Network (DDN) and the internet. Her group operated the Network Information Center (NIC) for it. 
<br>
Born in Wheeling, West Virginia, she grew up there. She was the 1st person in her family to go to college and get her undergraduate degree. Feinler was trying to work towards her PHD in biochemistry. She was attending Purdue University in order to get it. At the same time when she was working for a year or two trying to earn some money before starting her thesis. 
<br>
She worked as an assistant editor on a project that was trying to indicate the world’s chemical compounds. While working at the chemical abstracts service in Columbus, Ohio. When she was there she got interested in the challenges of making such large data complications. Because of this she left biochemistry and never returned to it. 
In 1960 she moved to California and decided to join the Information Research Department at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI International). There she worked to create the Handbooks of Psychopharmacology and Chemical Process Economics. 
<br>
When she was leading the Literature Research Section of SRI’s library, in 1972. She was signed up to join the Augmentation Research Center (ARC), which was supported by the Information Processing Techniques Office of the US Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA). The first thing that she had to do was write a Resource Handbook at the International Computer communication conference for the ARPANET. She became the principal investigator to help plan and manage the new Network Information Center (NIC) for the ARPANET. 
<br>
The NIC gave reference service to users ( at first by phone and by sending mail physically), continued and produced a list of people (the “white pages”), then the resource and protocol handbook. Resource handbook (the “yellow pages”, a list of services). Beranek and Newman gave brand new hosts on the network, the NIC entered names, gave privilege to control terminals, information on audit trail and billing, and gave out Request for Comments (RFCs). She worked with the members of the Network Working Group (NWG), to form RFCs into the approved set of technological notes for the ARPANET and not that long after that the internet. The NIC gave the first links to online documents, by using the NLS Journal System created at ARC. Engelbart kept doing leading-edge research for the ARC, while the NIC gave a service to all people who use different networks. This led up to the NIC becoming a separate project for Feinler.
